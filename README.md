# Serial Port Identifier
Program to easily list and physically identify all serial ports installed on a computer.

## Usage

* Build a dongle with a basic DB9 connector and join only pins 2 (Rx) and 3 (Tx) together.
* Disconnect all serial port connectors from the PC.
* Connect your dongle alternately to all ports
* The "control button" associated with the connected port will be switched to the selected state.
* Enjoy ;-)
